            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I attended USAP Community School for my high school education. 
                Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Ashesi University.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am an inquisitive student who enjoys learning and confronting new challenges, 
                as they provide opportunities for growth and knowledge acquisition. My skills 
                include data structures and algorithms, building machine learning models, and 
                web development. I have actively participated in school programming challenges and 
                hackathons, utilizing programming languages such as Python, Java, and JavaScript.
            </p>

            <p>
                Outside of the classroom, I love playing sports. Itâ€™s a great way to meet new 
                people and make friends while staying active and healthy. Additionally, I practice yoga, 
                which gives me an opportunity to reunite with nature and find balance.
  
            </p>
